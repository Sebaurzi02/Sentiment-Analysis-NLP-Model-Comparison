    "In this notebook, we explore baseline approaches for sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews. Specifically, we implement and evaluate two widely used classifiers: **Logistic Regression** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes**. The text data undergoes essential cleaning steps such as lowercasing, punctuation removal, and lemmatization, but we intentionally **retain stopwords** and **do not apply dimensionality reduction**. This allows us to assess the models' performance under minimal preprocessing conditions. We employ both **Bag of Words (BoW)** and **TF-IDF** representations for feature extraction and compare the models based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics. The results from this notebook will serve as a reference point for comparison with more advanced techniques in subsequent analyses."
