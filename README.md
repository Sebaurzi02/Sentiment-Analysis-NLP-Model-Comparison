# Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a **Sentiment Analysis** pipeline using three classic classification algorithms: **Logistic Regression (LR)** , **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)** and **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**. The goal is to classify text data into positive or negative sentiment classesand make comparisons and reach conclusions based on the results of the studied models.

 # Dataset: IMDb
The IMDb dataset consists of 50,000 rows of data containing two main columns, namely "review," which contains the text of English movie reviews, and "sentiment," which indicates the sentiment label as positive (1) or negative (0). Here are the detailed explanations

### Table: Structure of the IMDb Dataset

| No. | Column    | Data Type     | Description                                                             |
|-----|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.  | review    | String        | Text of English movie reviews                                           |
| 2.  | sentiment | Integer       | Target column indicating the sentiment label as positive (1) or negative (0) based on the review |

## üìù Notebook Overview

The main notebook (`Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`) walks through the complete process of preparing the data and training classification models using two different vectorization techniques: **Bag of Words (BoW)** and **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.

###  Steps :

1. ### **Text Preprocessing**

   * Duplicate removal
   * Elimination of noise (special characters, punctuation, etc.)
   * HTML tag stripping
   * Lowercasing, stemming, and tokenization using basic NLP techniques

2. ### **Model Training**

   * Vectorization of cleaned text using both **BoW** and **TF-IDF**
   * Training of two classifiers:

     * Logistic Regression (LR)
     * Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)

3. ### üìà **Model Evaluation**

   * Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   * Confusion matrices
   * Comparison between the four combinations:

     * LR + BoW
     * LR + TFIDF
     * MNB + BoW
     * MNB + TFIDF
   * Runtime measurements for each configuration

4. ### **Final Comparison**

   * A final discussion compares model performance to determine the most effective approach for this sentiment classification task.
