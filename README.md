# Sentiment Analysis using TF-IDF and Multinomial Naive Bayes
 This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual data by representing the documents using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method. The processed features are then used to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which predicts whether a given piece of text expresses a positive or negative sentiment.

 ## Problem Statement
 Audience reviews and sentiment expressed on platforms like IMDb have a substantial impact on todayâ€™s film industry. Due to the vast amount of data generated, manually processing this information is impractical, making machine learning approaches more suitable. Lightweight models such as Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes, combined with Bag of Words and TF-IDF techniques, offer fast, efficient, and cost-effective sentiment analysis. This process is valuable for film producers, enabling better success prediction and targeted marketing. It also lays the groundwork for future steps like model deployment or enhancing performance with more advanced algorithms

 # Project Aim
 ## Enhancing Sentiment Analysis Efficiency and Reducing Costs in the Film Industry
 The primary objective of this project is to employ machine learning techniques to enhance the efficiency of sentiment analysis applied to movie reviews. This study aims to achieve notable improvements in both processing time and cost-effectiveness. By doing so, it seeks to offer a scalable and economically viable solution for managing large volumes of textual data, thereby outperforming conventional manual or rule-based approaches in terms of practicality and performance.

 # Dataset: IMDb
The IMDb dataset consists of 50,000 rows of data containing two main columns, namely "review," which contains the text of English movie reviews, and "sentiment," which indicates the sentiment label as positive (1) or negative (0). Here are the detailed explanations
