# Sentiment Analysis using TF-IDF and Multinomial Naive Bayes
## This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual data by representing the documents using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method. The processed features are then used to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which predicts whether a given piece of text expresses a positive or negative sentiment.
